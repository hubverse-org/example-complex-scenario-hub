# example-complex-scenario-hub

**This repository is in development.**

This repository serves as an example of a scenario modeling hub, modeled after the [US Scenario Modeling Hub](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub) or the [European COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-forecast-hub-europe). Researchers from these teams have created the Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs to provide a [recommended set of standards and documentation](https://hubverse.io/en/latest/index.html) for building and maintaining collaborative modeling hubs.

It is recommended that new Hubs create a Hub repository by buiding on the [hubTemplate repository](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubTemplate).
